Yes, this is definitely possible! The idea would be to dynamically generate the level-up button based on the XP value. When the XP reaches a threshold (e.g., every 1000 XP), the button appears. Clicking this button would trigger a series of prompts or a modal window guiding the player through the level-up process (selecting stats to increase, spending perk points, and spending skill points).

Steps to Implement This Feature
Monitor XP Value:

Add a function to monitor the XP value and check if it meets or exceeds the threshold for leveling up.
Display Level-Up Button:

If the XP threshold is met, dynamically display the level-up button.
Level-Up Process:

When the level-up button is clicked, show a modal window or series of prompts for the player to select stats to increase, spend perk points, and spend skill points.
Update Character Sheet:

Update the character sheet with the new level, increased stats, and spent points.
Implementation Outline
HTML Structure:

Add an XP input field and a hidden level-up button.
JavaScript Functions:

Monitor the XP value.
Display the level-up button when the XP threshold is met.
Handle the level-up process (show prompts/modal, update character sheet).
Example Plan (No Code Yet)
HTML:

Input field for XP.
Hidden level-up button.
JavaScript:

Function to check XP value and display the button if the threshold is met.
Event listener for the level-up button to show a modal or series of prompts.
Functions to handle stat selection, perk point spending, and skill point spending.
Update the character sheet with the new values.
Example Workflow
Monitor XP:

When the XP input field value changes, check if it meets or exceeds 1000 (or the next threshold).
Display Level-Up Button:

If the threshold is met, display the level-up button.
Level-Up Process:

Clicking the button triggers a modal or series of prompts.
The player selects which stats to increase, spends perk points, and skill points.
The modal collects these selections.
Update Character Sheet:

After the player completes the level-up process, update the character's level, stats, perks, and skills accordingly.
Reset or hide the level-up button until the next threshold is met.
This plan allows for a structured and user-friendly level-up process that can be easily integrated into the character sheet.

Would you like to proceed with implementing this feature after we complete the basic structure, or would you prefer to integrate it as we build?
